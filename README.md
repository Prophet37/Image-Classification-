This is an implementation of Keras, which is a deep learning library, which can help in image classification and various applications. Here we use the Fashion MNIST dataset and see the high level accuracy achieved to predict the values..

### The Challenge
#### To build an image classifier with Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks for the Fashion MNIST dataset. This data set includes 10 labels of different clothing types with 28 by 28 grayscale images. There is a training set of 60,000 images and 10,000 test images.
## Label   Description
## 0       T-shirt/top
## 1       Trouser
## 2       Pullover
## 3       Dress
## 4       Coat
## 5       Sandal
## 6       Shirt
## 7       Sneaker
## 8       Bag
## 9       Ankle boot
